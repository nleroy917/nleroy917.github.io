I took a basic photography class my Sophomore year of high school. It was all 35mm film-based. I had to shoot my film, develop the negatives, and use a dark to create and develop my prints. I really learned a lot. That was almost a decade ago, however. Recently, I wanted to try again. So, I picked up an old [Canon A-1](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film100.html) off eBay with some Kodak Gold 200 film. To warm up again, I walked around grounds and the surrounding area and took pictures of anything I found interesting. Below are the ones that I felt turned out the best.

<small>_I really liked the angle of this shot. It hides the people and provides a peaceful scene._</small>

<small>_I loved the way the color of the brick turned out on the West Complex. Also, I am not sure where that lady is running._</small>

<small>_The way I was able to capture the green hills in the back with the rough-looking scenery of Frys Spring Station looked cool to me._</small>
