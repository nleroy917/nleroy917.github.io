# Unplugging from the AI matrix
I saw this comment on social media recently -- I think it was Reddit:

> Programming without AI feels like reading a book, whereas programming _with_ AI feels like scrolling TikTok.

Honestly, it really resonated with me. It really captured a feeling I've had for a long time deep inside me. I was trying to intellectualize this while laying in bed the other night, staring at the ceiling. I turned over to my fiance and I said, _"You know... I feel like I've just gotten worse at everything. Programming, writing, system design... all of it!"_ When asked why I felt this way, I found it difficult to fully identify a root cause. The feeling, however, was crystal clear: I felt like, despite having nearly a decade of experience under my belt, today I write worse code, in less time, and come up with sub-par solutions more than ever. I've long felt that this has been a result of overuse of AI technologies in my development workflow, and this reddit comment really solified the thought for me.

## Hitting the AI slots

Like a monkey pulling a slot machine over and over and over again, waiting for the next big hit; I now realize that my development workflow has transitioned from one focused on understanding, planning, and executing, to one that mimicks the addictive loop of swiping through short form video or betting on slots: prompt after prompt, tab after tab, watching the tokens fly by hoping the AI gets it right. Many times, it does! Other's it does not. Which one will it be this time? I dunno! Better pull that lever and try again...

This phenomenon is well-documented. In his book [Scarcity Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75494984-scarcity-brain), author Michael Easter describes something called the **"scarcity brain feedback loop"**, which is a cycle comprised of three components: opportunity, unpredictable rewards, and quick repeatability. I realized that these AI-centered development workflows mimicked this "scarcity brain" feedback loop to a tea.

First, comes the opportunity: the chance to generate some nice code that works. Then, unpredictable rewards: not knowing if the code will work or fail when generated. Finally, quick repeatability: if it doesnt work, I can always prompt again, or hit tab one more time. `"Plz fix no mistakes."` The most important and detrimental consequence of this feedback loop, however is not even its affect on my skills/abilities as a programmer, but it seems to have cracked the very foundation that started me on this journey in the first place: **its no longer fun!**

Even now, as I sit here writing this post, I can _feel_ my hands twitch as they try and reach for the ChatGPT app to write this for me (ironic, huh?). Or what about the pause after each phrase I type, waiting for co-pilot to finish my thoughts/sentences. Like little miniature games in the lobby, keeping me hooked and wanting more. Is the next sentence going to be profound and evoke emotion in someone reading it?

## What am I going to do about it?

I'm not really here to argue whether or not AI-generated code is slop (it is); nor am I here to argue whether or not AI can replace software engineers (it can't). I'm simply trying to draw parallels between the reward cycles and behavioral patterns between hitting the slots and programming with Claude code. I want to take back what was once mine: a love and passion for developement. When I think about what made me a half-way decent developer in the first place (emphasis on half-way), it had nothing to do with the destination and everything to do with the journey. Wrestling with error messages for hours, days, weeks. Building something from scratch that once existed only in the fabic of my mind. Sharing that "something" with friends and family and feeling the sense of satisfaction knowing I did it all, and someone else enjoys it!

## A final analogy
Doctor Strange, when asked by the ancient one,

> How did you get to reattach severed nerves and put a human spine back together bone by bone?

He responds somberly,

> Study and practice, years of it

I promised I wasn't going to argue that AI-generated code is slop, but I just can't help. myself. I'm a true believe that the proof is always in the pudding, and that real greatness comes from study and practice; years of it. I think that as developers we should embrace AI
