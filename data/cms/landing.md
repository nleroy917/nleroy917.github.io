# Welcome to my personal website

## Bio
My name is Nathan and I am a 2nd year PhD student at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering). Born and raised in Cincinnati, OH, I have a passion for science and technology that was nurtured from a young age.

I honed my skills as an undergraduate student at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ABE), where I studied biological engineering. After graduation, I put my education to work at the [Indiana Biosciences Research Institute](https://www.indianabiosciences.org/), where I spent two years gaining valuable experience in the field.

Now, as a graduate student in [the lab of Dr. Nathan Sheffield](https://databio.org/), I am exploring the exciting field of natural language processing and interpretable machine learning, applying these techniques to study genomics datasets. As a seasoned Python developer with a passion for web programming and development, I am always seeking new opportunities to challenge myself and expand my skills.

When I'm not studying or coding, you can find me out on a run, hiking in the great outdoors, or capturing memories through photography.
