#header("About")

I'm a machine learning engineer and developer advocate based in the New York metro area. I work at Qdrant, where I help developers build AI applications with vector search.

The most powerful ML systems are the ones people can actually use. My work focuses on making machine learning more accessible through better tooling, clearer explanations, and models that work outside the lab.

== Background

I #link("/dissertation")[completed my PhD] in computational biology at the University of Virginia, where I worked on representation learning for biological data. That experience taught me two things: 1) embeddings are surprisingly powerful, and 2) the gap between research and practice is often just good infrastructure and clear communication.

Now I spend my time bridging that gap — writing, building demos, and helping developers understand how to put ML into production without a research team.
